Mask RCNN for Keypoint Detection on Clothes
-----------------------------------

The original code is from "https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN" on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. The code reproduce the work of "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870" for human pose estimation.
This project aims to keypoint detection on clothes.
When I start it, I refer to another project https://github.com/Superlee506/Mask_RCNN_Humanpose

## Requirements
* Python 3.5+
* TensorFlow 1.3+
* Keras 2.0.8+
* Numpy, skimage, scipy, Pillow, cython, h5py
